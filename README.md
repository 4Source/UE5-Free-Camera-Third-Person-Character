# UE5 Free Camera Third Person Character
This is an example project how to freely rotate a camera around the character without changing its direction of movement (ForwardVector). This setup is meant to be used with no direct input keys to move around (because it feels weird but if you want), it's e.g. for character following a spline, with the camera rotating freely around the character.
